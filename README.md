# Morse-code-via-a-binary-tree
Morse code can be implemented with the help of a binary tree, where, for example, a left subtree means adding a dot and a right subtree means adding a dash. That way, the letter 'k', which in Morse code is written as "- . -", can be positioned in the root of the right subtree of the left subtree of the right subtree of the original tree of the Morse code.
